# The Power of Prayer

Prayer is one of the most powerful tools God has given us, yet many of us struggle to maintain a consistent prayer life. In this message, we'll explore the importance of prayer and how to develop a deeper prayer life.

## Why Pray?

- Prayer is communication with God
- Prayer changes us and our circumstances
- Prayer aligns our will with God's will
- Prayer is an act of dependence on God

## How to Pray

Jesus gave us a model for prayer in the Lord's Prayer. We can use this as a template for our own prayers:

1. **Adoration** - Praise God for who He is
2. **Confession** - Acknowledge our sins
3. **Thanksgiving** - Thank God for His blessings
4. **Supplication** - Present our requests to God

## This Week's Challenge

Commit to spending at least 10 minutes in prayer each day this week. Start with the Lord's Prayer and then add your own words.
