# The Foundation of Faith

In this message, we explore what it means to build our lives on the solid foundation of faith in Jesus Christ. Drawing from Matthew 7:24-27, we'll discover the importance of not just hearing God's Word, but putting it into practice.

## Key Points

1. **The Wise Builder** - Building on the rock means hearing and obeying God's Word
2. **The Foolish Builder** - Building on sand represents hearing but not obeying
3. **The Test of Storms** - Life's challenges reveal the foundation we've built on

## Application

As we go through this week, let's ask ourselves: Are we building our lives on the solid foundation of God's Word, or are we building on the shifting sand of our own wisdom and desires?

## Scripture References

- Matthew 7:24-27
- 1 Corinthians 3:11
- Psalm 127:1
