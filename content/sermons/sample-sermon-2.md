# Walking in Love

This week we dive into 1 Corinthians 13, often called the "Love Chapter." We'll explore what it truly means to love others as Christ loves us, and how this kind of love should characterize our relationships.

## What is Love?

Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs.

## Practical Steps

1. Practice patience in difficult relationships
2. Show kindness to those who don't deserve it
3. Forgive as we have been forgiven
4. Put others' needs before our own

## Reflection Questions

- How can I show love to someone who is difficult to love?
- What does it mean to love without keeping a record of wrongs?
- How does God's love for me change how I love others?
