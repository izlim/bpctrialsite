# The Power of Gratitude

*"Give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."* - 1 Thessalonians 5:18

## Reflection

Gratitude is a powerful spiritual discipline that transforms our perspective. When we choose to be thankful, even in difficult circumstances, we shift our focus from what we lack to what we have been given.

God doesn't call us to be thankful *for* all circumstances (some are genuinely difficult), but He does call us to be thankful *in* all circumstances. This means we can find something to be grateful for even in the midst of trials.

## Prayer

Heavenly Father, thank You for Your many blessings in my life. Help me to develop a heart of gratitude that sees Your goodness even in difficult times. Amen.

## Application

Make a list of ten things you're grateful for today. Include both big and small blessings. Share your gratitude with someone else.
