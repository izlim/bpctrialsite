# Trusting God in Difficult Times

*"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding."* - Proverbs 3:5

## Reflection

Life is full of challenges and uncertainties. When we face difficult circumstances, it's natural to want to figure everything out on our own. But God calls us to trust Him completely, even when we don't understand what's happening.

Trusting God doesn't mean we ignore our problems or pretend everything is fine. It means we acknowledge that God is in control, that He loves us, and that He is working all things together for our good (Romans 8:28).

## Prayer

Lord, help me to trust You completely, even when I don't understand what You're doing. Give me the faith to believe that You are working for my good, even in the midst of difficult circumstances. Amen.

## Application

Today, identify one area where you're struggling to trust God. Write it down and commit it to prayer, asking God to help you trust Him more.
